This is the technology blog of Tobias Fenster, CTO at <a href="https://www.cosmoconsult.com" target="_blank">Cosmo Consult</a> and dual <a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5002758?fullName=Tobias%20Fenster" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP</a>. I usually write about Dynamics 365 (most history on NAV / Business Central), Azure and Docker. Coming from a development background but with also a lot of experience around infrastructure and operations, my topics range from dev to ops and of course DevOps.

This blog is a personal effort, so it doesn't necessarily show in which direction my employer is going or what technologies are relevant there.
